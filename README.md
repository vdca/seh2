# Deviants are detected faster at the end of verse-like sound sequences

This repository contains supplementary code and data for the following paper:

Arrazola, V. DC. Deviants are detected faster at the end of verse-like sound sequences.

## Contents

- `code/seh2_analysis.R`: script containing the functions and commands necessary to reproduce the data filtering, transformation, statistical analyses, figures and tables described in the paper.

- `data/seh2_response_data.tsv`: tab-separated dataframe containing all the reaction time (RT) responses recorded during the experiment (N=2,654), plus related variables. Each of the columns is described below.

- `data/seh2_processed_data.tsv`: tab-separated dataframe containing a subset of the observations (N=2,027); this is the dataset used in the statistical analyses. It is derived from the preceding file, but it excludes incorrect responses (e.g. missed probes, false alarms), and incorporates a number of derived variables (e.g. z-normalised RTs).
